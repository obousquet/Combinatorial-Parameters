# Combinatorial Parameters Database

This repository contains a structured database of combinatorial parameters, classes, relationships, and values, organized for mathematical research and reference.

## Structure
- `data/classes/` — Set families (possibly parameterized)
- `data/parameters/` — Parameters measuring the size of set families
- `data/relationships/` — Relationships between parameters
- `data/values/` — Values assigned to parameters for specific classes

Each subdirectory contains:
- A `schema.json` file describing the structure and fields for entries
- Generated JSON files for each entry
